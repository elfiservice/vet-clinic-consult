# Vet Clinics Consult
A single page application (SPA). Where you can consult by veterinary clinicians by your names and see more details clicking on their names.

As a test, I used this package to make a fake back-end like a REST API [https://github.com/typicode/json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

## Getting Started
To test in your local machine, just follow the steps below:
### Back-End
- Open a terminal and go into the ``back-end`` folder.
- Execute ``npm install -g json-server`` if not already installed
- And ``json-server --watch db.json`` to launch the server
### Front-End
- Open another terminal and go into the ``front-end`` folder.
- Execute ``npm install`` to install all dependencs
- Execute ``npm run start`` to launch the App on the [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
